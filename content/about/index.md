## About Me {.section-heading}

I'm **Esteban D. Gadea**, a postdoctoral researcher in the [<u>**Molinero Group**</u>](https://molinero.hec.utah.edu) at the University of Utah. I work in **computational physical chemistry**, using multiscale simulations to explore phenomena at the intersection of **electrochemistry**, **interfaces**, and **energy conversion**.

My research centers on systems where gas evolution, material disorder, and reactive environments convergeâ€”such as:
- The formation and stability of **nanobubbles**,
- **High entropy oxides** as electrocatalysts, and
- Membrane-catalyst interactions in electrochemical devices.

## My Path {.section-heading}

I began my scientific journey at the [<u>**Universidad Nacional de La Plata**</u>](https://unlp.edu.ar), where I earned my chemistry degree and worked with **Prof. MartÃ­n Lavecchia** at [<u>**CEQUINOR**</u>](https://cequinor.conicet.gov.ar). There, I studied drug binding on carbonic anhydrase using **docking**, **molecular dynamics**, and **QTAIM**â€”my first hands-on experience combining methods across scales.

That project sparked my passion for computational chemistry and the kinds of questions that require more than one theoretical lens.
I pursued a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry at the [<u>**University of Buenos Aires**</u>](https://www.uba.ar) under **Prof. Damian Scherlis**. As a graduate studen in [<u>**INQUIMAE**</u>](http://inquimae2.qi.fcen.uba.ar/institucional/), I focused on the thermodynamics and electrochemical nucleation of surface nanobubbles. I also began collaborations with groups in the U.S. and U.K., which helped shape my current interdisciplinary approach.

ince joining the [<u>**University of Utah**</u>](https://www.utah.edu), I've worked on **kinetic Monte Carlo**, **coarse-grained MD**, and **interface-aware electron-transfer** models. My current work blends **thermodynamics**, **kinetics**, and **quantum chemistry** to build models that are physically sound and computationally efficient.

## Philosophy {.section-heading}

For me, computational chemistry is about building models that say something usefulâ€”clear enough to interpret, detailed enough to matter. I aim to **distill complexity without flattening it**.

I rely on **thermodynamics**, **kinetics**, **statistical mechanics**, and **quantum chemistry**â€”not out of habit, but because they're the right tools to understand how things work across scales.
I donâ€™t stick to a method. I build what the question demands.

I especially enjoy working with experimental collaboratorsâ€”not just to explain what happened, but to ask better questions about what could.

## Teaching & Scientific Communication {.section-heading}

I spent eight years teaching in the Analytical Chemistry Department at the **Universidad Nacional de La Plata**, where I was involved in courses across Pharmacy, Biochemistry, Chemistry, and Chemical Engineering.
That experience didnâ€™t just strengthen my communicationâ€”it also deepened my interest in electrochemistry, which eventually shaped my research direction.

Today, I remain committed to scientific communication through writing, presenting, and mentoring. I serve as a **Journal Club Panelist for PNAS**, where early-career scientists highlight timely research across fields.

## Looking Forward {.section-heading}

My research is converging around a clear niche: **multiscale modeling of electrochemical systems for energy applications**. I'm especially interested in:
- Emerging catalyst architectures like **high entropy oxides**,
- The interplay between **gas evolution, confinement, and interfaces**, and
- Building models that couple physical processes across scales.

My long-term goal is to establish a research program that bridges **physical chemistry**, **materials science**, and **simulation**, to not only interpret experimentsâ€”but to guide them.
