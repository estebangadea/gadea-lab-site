## About Me {.section-heading}

I'm **Esteban D. Gadea**, a postdoctoral researcher in the Molinero Group at the University of Utah. I specialize in **computational physical chemistry**, using multiscale simulation techniques to study chemical systems that span from the atomistic to the mesoscale.

My research focuses on problems in **electrochemistry and energy conversion**, such as:
- The formation and stability of **nanobubbles** during gas-evolving reactions,
- The use of **high entropy oxides** as electrocatalysts,
- The role of membranes and interfaces in catalytic environments.

## My Path {.section-heading}

I began my academic journey at the **Universidad Nacional de La Plata**, where I earned my chemistry degree. As an undergraduate, I conducted research at **CEQUINOR** under **Prof. Martín Lavecchia**, investigating the binding of sugar-based drugs to carbonic anhydrase using **molecular docking**, **molecular dynamics**, and **QTAIM** analysis.

Although I no longer work with biomolecules, that project was a turning point. It sparked my interest in computational chemistry and showed me the power of combining methods across different theoretical scales—a theme that continues to guide my work today.

I went on to complete my Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry at the **University of Buenos Aires**, focusing on the thermodynamics and electrochemical nucleation of surface nanobubbles. During this time, I began collaborations that led to joint publications with groups in the U.S. and U.K., further strengthening my interdisciplinary perspective.

Since joining the University of Utah, I’ve expanded into **kinetic Monte Carlo methods**, coarse-grained molecular dynamics, and interface-aware transport models. My toolkit now blends thermodynamics, kinetics, and quantum chemistry into a flexible framework for exploring electrochemical systems.

## Philosophy {.section-heading}

I see **computational chemistry as the art of building models** that are as simple as possible—never simpler. For me, the goal is to **distill complexity without oversimplifying**, capturing the essential physics and chemistry behind the phenomena.

The tools I return to again and again are **thermodynamics**, **kinetics**, **statistical mechanics**, and **quantum chemistry**. These form my conceptual toolkit—my “weapons”—for approaching new questions.

Whether I’m simulating charge transport to nanoclusters or gas evolution on curved surfaces, I don’t adhere to a fixed set of methods. I **build whatever model it takes** to understand the problem at hand. If the question is interesting, I’ll do whatever’s needed to answer it.

I also believe modeling is most powerful when it engages with experiment—not just explaining results post hoc, but offering predictions, clarifying mechanisms, and even revealing unexpected possibilities.

## Teaching & Scientific Communication {.section-heading}

I have always loved teaching. During my time in Argentina, I served for eight years as a teaching assistant in the Analytical Chemistry Department at the **Universidad Nacional de La Plata**. I was involved in electrochemical analysis courses across Pharmacy, Biochemistry, Chemistry, and Chemical Engineering programs.

That classroom experience didn't just improve my ability to communicate—it also deepened my interest in **electrochemistry**, which later shaped my research.

I remain committed to scientific communication through writing, presenting, and mentoring. I'm currently part of the **Journal Club Panel for PNAS**, where early-career researchers highlight timely, cross-cutting science from the literature. The panel includes postdocs and PhD students affiliated with National Academy of Sciences member labs across a wide range of fields and institutions.

## Looking Forward {.section-heading}

My research is evolving toward a coherent niche: **multiscale modeling of electrochemical systems with energy applications**. I’m particularly excited about:
- Mechanistic insights into emerging catalyst architectures (like high entropy oxides),
- The subtle interplay between **gas evolution, confinement, and interfaces**, and
- Extending simulations across **coupled scales and phenomena**.

Ultimately, I aim to build a research program that bridges physical chemistry, materials science, and computational modeling—to not only interpret experimental results, but to predict and guide them.
