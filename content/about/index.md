I am a computational physical chemist working on **multiscale modeling of electrochemical interfaces** for energy applications. My work integrates atomistic simulations, kinetic Monte Carlo, and statistical mechanics to understand:

- **Disordered catalysts** (e.g., high-entropy oxides)
- **Nanobubble formation and gas evolution** in confined electrochemical environments
- **Membrane and ionomer effects** on performance and degradation

The goal of my research is to connect molecular-level mechanisms to macroscopic behavior in electrocatalytic systems like water electrolysis and CO‚ÇÇ reduction, contributing to the design of more efficient and durable energy devices.
