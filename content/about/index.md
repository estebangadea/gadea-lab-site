## About Me {.section-heading}

I'm **Esteban D. Gadea**, a postdoctoral researcher in the [<u>**Molinero Group**</u>](https://molinero.hec.utah.edu) at the University of Utah. I work in **computational physical chemistry**, using multiscale simulations to explore phenomena at the intersection of **electrochemistry**, **interfaces**, and **energy conversion**.

My research centers on systems where gas evolution, material disorder, and reactive environments converge‚Äîsuch as:
- The formation and stability of **nanobubbles**,
- **High entropy oxides** as electrocatalysts, and
- Membrane-catalyst interactions in electrochemical devices.

## Philosophy {.section-heading}

For me, computational chemistry is about building models that say something useful‚Äîclear enough to interpret, detailed enough to matter. I aim to **distill complexity without flattening it**.

I rely on **thermodynamics**, **kinetics**, **statistical mechanics**, and **quantum chemistry**‚Äînot out of habit, but because they're the right tools to understand how things work across scales.

<blockquote class="pullquote">
  ‚ÄúI refine what exists and imagine what‚Äôs missing‚Äîuntil the model carries the weight of the question.‚Äù
</blockquote>

I especially enjoy working with experimental collaborators‚Äînot just to explain what happened, but to ask better questions about what could.

## Teaching & Scientific Communication {.section-heading}

I spent eight years teaching in the Analytical Chemistry Department at the **Universidad Nacional de La Plata**, where I was involved in courses across Pharmacy, Biochemistry, Chemistry, and Chemical Engineering.
That experience didn‚Äôt just strengthen my communication‚Äîit also deepened my interest in electrochemistry, which eventually shaped my research direction.

Today, I remain committed to scientific communication through writing, presenting, and mentoring. I serve as a **Journal Club Panelist for PNAS**, where early-career scientists highlight timely research across fields.

## Looking Forward {.section-heading}

My research is converging around a clear niche: **multiscale modeling of electrochemical systems for energy applications**. I'm especially interested in:
- Emerging catalyst architectures like **high entropy oxides**,
- The interplay between **gas evolution, confinement, and interfaces**, and
- Building models that couple physical processes across scales.

My long-term goal is to establish a research program that bridges **physical chemistry**, **materials science**, and **simulation**, to not only interpret experiments‚Äîbut to guide them.
